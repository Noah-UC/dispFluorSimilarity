Description: This package is meant to help select antibody conjugations for flow cytometry.
	     Fluorochromes often have overlapping visible spectra and this causes issues using them together in flow cytometry.
	     Cytek Biosciences (that makes flow cytometers) has data on how much two fluorochromes overlap (similarity index).
 	     Cytek used to offer this freely on spectrum.cytekbio.com, but has now locked this information behind a login. 
	     This function takes a list of character strings that contains the names of the fluorochromes that the user is trying to evaluate, and prints a heatmap of their similarity 	     index.
